<h1> Credit Card Debt </h1>

<p>First, tell me about your credit card debt:</p>

<form action="/card_submission" method='POST'>
    	 Credit Card Name:
    	 <!-- insert little 'i' comments here to explain stuff -->
    <br>
    	<input type="text" name="card1_name" required>
    <br>
    	Amount of Debt:
    <br>
    	<input type="number" name="card1_debt" required>
    <br>
    	Annual Percentage Rate (APR):
    <br>
    	<input type="number" name="card1_apr" required>
    <br>
    	<!-- Have this one be optional. Useful for 0% apr. Have logic for this one. If apr == 0 then display. -->
    	<!-- In case I want to implement this in JS: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6982692/html5-input-type-date-default-value-to-today -->
    	Date to pay off:
	  	<input type="date" name="card1_date" min="2015-05-10">

    <br>
    <br>	
    	<input type="submit" value="Let's Do This!">
</form>

<!-- TODO:  -->
<!-- figure out how to do a max of three years for date? Or is that necessary..... -->
<!-- Make the different credit card '+' options pop up after someone clicks, "add another credit card" button -->
<!-- assumption: there can be up to seven cards someone can enter per account.

<!-- For now, have only one credit card info show up. Then start playing with this more in server.py -->
