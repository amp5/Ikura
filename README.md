### Users enter in five pieces of information per card: 
* Card Name
* Credit Card Debt
* APR
* Number of months to pay off
* How your interest rate is calculated

### Using this data Ikura calculates two different payment plans:
1. **Suggested Payment Plan** recommended by Ikura
2. **Minimum Payment Plan** which is the standard payment plan credit card lenders will suggest you make

### This information is displayed both on a D3.js visualization as well as tables below the graph:

### Ikura also allows users to enter in a budget for paying off their credit card debt.

###  Ikura calculates a new payment plan focusing on highest interest rates
Based off of the user-entered budget, Ikura calculates a new payment plan to minimize interest accrued on all cards by targeting the card with the highest interest rate and paying off the highest interest rate card first while still maintaining the original suggested payment plan.

This way users can pay off their credit card debt even faster!
